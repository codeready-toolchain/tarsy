## Chat Assistant Instructions

You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) assistant helping with follow-up questions about a completed alert investigation.

The user has reviewed the investigation results and has follow-up questions. Your role is to:
- Provide clear, actionable answers based on the investigation history
- Use available tools to gather fresh, real-time data when needed
- Reference specific findings from the original investigation when relevant
- Maintain the same professional SRE communication style
- Be concise but thorough in your responses

You have access to the same tools and systems that were used in the original investigation.

## Response Guidelines

1. **Context Awareness**: Reference the investigation history when it provides relevant context
2. **Fresh Data**: Use tools to gather current system state if the question requires up-to-date information
3. **Clarity**: If the question is ambiguous or unclear, ask for clarification in your Final Answer
4. **Specificity**: Always reference actual data and observations, not assumptions
5. **Brevity**: Be concise but complete - users have already read the full investigation

Focus on answering follow-up questions about a completed investigation for human operators to execute.

## Alert Details

### Alert Metadata
**Alert Type:** test-alert

### Alert Data
<!-- ALERT_DATA_START -->
Pod OOMKilled
<!-- ALERT_DATA_END -->

## Runbook Content
````markdown
<!-- RUNBOOK START -->
# Generic Troubleshooting Guide

## Investigation Steps

1. **Analyze the alert** - Review alert data and identify affected system/service
2. **Gather context** - Use tools to check current state and recent changes
3. **Identify root cause** - Investigate potential causes based on alert type
4. **Assess impact** - Determine scope and severity
5. **Recommend actions** - Suggest safe investigation or remediation steps

## Guidelines

- Verify information before suggesting changes
- Consider dependencies and potential side effects
- Document findings and actions taken
- Focus on understanding the problem before proposing solutions
- When in doubt, gather more information rather than making assumptions

## Common Investigation Patterns

### For Performance Issues
- Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Review recent deployments or configuration changes
- Analyze metrics and logs for anomalies
- Identify bottlenecks in the request path

### For Availability Issues
- Verify service health and readiness
- Check for recent restarts or crashes
- Review dependencies and upstream services
- Examine load balancer and routing configuration

### For Error Rate Spikes
- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Correlate with recent deployments
- Check for external service failures
- Review input validation and edge cases

📋 INVESTIGATION HISTORY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Stage 1: investigation

**Agent:** DataCollector (native-thinking, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

Let me check the cluster nodes and pod status.

**Agent Response:**

I'll look up the nodes and pods.

**Tool Call:** test-mcp.get_nodes({})
**Result:**

[{"name":"worker-1","status":"Ready","cpu":"4","memory":"16Gi"}]

**Tool Call:** test-mcp.get_pods({"namespace":"default"})
**Result (summarized):**

Pod pod-1 is OOMKilled with 5 restarts.

**Internal Reasoning:**

Let me check the memory metrics for pod-1.

**Agent Response:**

Querying Prometheus for memory usage.

**Tool Call:** prometheus-mcp.query_metrics({"query":"container_memory_usage_bytes{pod=\"pod-1\"}"})
**Result:**

[{"metric":"container_memory_usage_bytes","pod":"pod-1","value":"524288000","timestamp":"{TIMESTAMP}"}]

**Internal Reasoning:**

The pod is clearly OOMKilled.

**Agent Response:**

Investigation complete: pod-1 is OOMKilled with 5 restarts.

**Final Analysis:**

Investigation complete: pod-1 is OOMKilled with 5 restarts.

## Stage 2: remediation

**Agent:** Remediator (react, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

I should check the pod logs to understand the OOM pattern.

**Tool Call:** test-mcp.get_pod_logs({"pod":"pod-1","namespace":"default"})
**Result:**

{"pod":"pod-1","logs":"OOMKilled at 14:30:00 - memory usage exceeded 512Mi limit"}

**Internal Reasoning:**

Let me check the Prometheus alert history for memory-related alerts.

**Tool Call:** prometheus-mcp.query_alerts({"query":"ALERTS{alertname=\"OOMKilled\",pod=\"pod-1\"}"})
**Result (summarized):**

OOMKilled alert fired 3 times in the last hour for pod-1.

**Internal Reasoning:**

The logs and alerts confirm repeated OOM kills due to memory pressure.

**Final Analysis:**

Recommend increasing memory limit to 1Gi and adding a HPA for pod-1.

## Stage 3: validation

<!-- PARALLEL_RESULTS_START -->

### Parallel Investigation: "validation" — 2/2 agents succeeded

#### Agent 1: ConfigValidator (react, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

I should verify the pod memory limits are properly configured.

**Tool Call:** test-mcp.get_resource_config({"pod":"pod-1","namespace":"default"})
**Result:**

{"pod":"pod-1","limits":{"memory":"512Mi","cpu":"250m"},"requests":{"memory":"256Mi","cpu":"100m"}}

**Internal Reasoning:**

The memory limit of 512Mi matches the alert threshold.

**Final Analysis:**

Config validated: pod-1 memory limit is 512Mi, matching the OOM threshold.

#### Agent 2: MetricsValidator (native-thinking, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

Let me verify the SLO metrics for pod-1.

**Agent Response:**

Checking SLO compliance.

**Tool Call:** prometheus-mcp.query_slo({"pod":"pod-1"})
**Result:**

[{"slo":"availability","target":0.999,"current":0.95,"pod":"pod-1","violation":true}]

**Internal Reasoning:**

SLO is being violated.

**Agent Response:**

Metrics confirm SLO violation for pod-1 availability.

**Final Analysis:**

Metrics confirm SLO violation for pod-1 availability.

<!-- PARALLEL_RESULTS_END -->
### Synthesis Result

Combined validation confirms pod-1 has correct memory limit of 512Mi but violates 99.9% availability SLO.

## Stage 4: scaling-review

<!-- PARALLEL_RESULTS_START -->

### Parallel Investigation: "scaling-review" — 2/2 agents succeeded

#### Agent 1: ScalingReviewer-1 (native-thinking, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

Evaluating horizontal scaling needs for pod-1.

**Agent Response:**

Current replicas=1 is insufficient. Recommend min=2 max=5 with 70% CPU target.

**Final Analysis:**

Current replicas=1 is insufficient. Recommend min=2 max=5 with 70% CPU target.

#### Agent 2: ScalingReviewer-2 (native-thinking, test-provider)
**Status**: completed

**Internal Reasoning:**

Evaluating horizontal scaling needs for pod-1.

**Agent Response:**

Current replicas=1 is insufficient. Recommend min=2 max=5 with 70% CPU target.

**Final Analysis:**

Current replicas=1 is insufficient. Recommend min=2 max=5 with 70% CPU target.

<!-- PARALLEL_RESULTS_END -->
### Synthesis Result

Both replicas confirm: set HPA to 70% CPU with min=2, max=5 replicas for pod-1.

## Executive Summary

Pod-1 OOM killed due to memory leak. Recommend increasing memory limit.
