=== MESSAGE: system ===
You are an expert at summarizing technical output from system administration and monitoring tools for ongoing incident investigation.

Your specific task is to summarize output from **prometheus-mcp.query_alerts** in a way that:

1. **Preserves Critical Information**: Keep all details essential for troubleshooting and investigation
2. **Maintains Investigation Context**: Focus on information relevant to what the investigator was looking for
3. **Reduces Verbosity**: Remove redundant details while preserving technical accuracy
4. **Highlights Key Findings**: Emphasize errors, warnings, unusual patterns, and actionable insights
5. **Stays Concise**: Keep summary under 1000 tokens while preserving meaning

## Summarization Guidelines:

- **Always Preserve**: Error messages, warnings, status indicators, resource metrics, timestamps
- **Intelligently Summarize**: Large lists by showing patterns, counts, and notable exceptions
- **Focus On**: Non-default configurations, problematic settings, resource utilization issues
- **Maintain**: Technical accuracy and context about what the data represents
- **Format**: Clean, structured text suitable for continued technical investigation
- **Be Conclusive**: Explicitly state what was found AND what was NOT found to prevent re-queries
- **Answer Questions**: If the investigation context suggests the investigator was looking for something specific, explicitly confirm whether it was present or absent

Your summary will be inserted as an observation in the ongoing investigation conversation.

=== MESSAGE: user ===
Below is the ongoing investigation conversation that provides context for what the investigator has been looking for:

## Investigation Context:
=== CONVERSATION START ===
[user]: ## Alert Details

### Alert Metadata
**Alert Type:** test-alert

### Alert Data
<!-- ALERT_DATA_START -->
Pod OOMKilled
<!-- ALERT_DATA_END -->

## Runbook Content
````markdown
<!-- RUNBOOK START -->
# Generic Troubleshooting Guide

## Investigation Steps

1. **Analyze the alert** - Review alert data and identify affected system/service
2. **Gather context** - Use tools to check current state and recent changes
3. **Identify root cause** - Investigate potential causes based on alert type
4. **Assess impact** - Determine scope and severity
5. **Recommend actions** - Suggest safe investigation or remediation steps

## Guidelines

- Verify information before suggesting changes
- Consider dependencies and potential side effects
- Document findings and actions taken
- Focus on understanding the problem before proposing solutions
- When in doubt, gather more information rather than making assumptions

## Common Investigation Patterns

### For Performance Issues
- Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Review recent deployments or configuration changes
- Analyze metrics and logs for anomalies
- Identify bottlenecks in the request path

### For Availability Issues
- Verify service health and readiness
- Check for recent restarts or crashes
- Review dependencies and upstream services
- Examine load balancer and routing configuration

### For Error Rate Spikes
- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Correlate with recent deployments
- Check for external service failures
- Review input validation and edge cases

## Previous Stage Data
<!-- CHAIN_CONTEXT_START -->

### Stage 1: investigation

Investigation complete: pod-1 is OOMKilled with 5 restarts.

<!-- CHAIN_CONTEXT_END -->

## Your Task
Use the available tools to investigate this alert and provide:
1. Root cause analysis
2. Current system state assessment
3. Specific remediation steps for human operators
4. Prevention recommendations

Be thorough in your investigation before providing the final answer.

## Tool Result to Summarize:
The investigator just executed `prometheus-mcp.query_alerts` and got the following output:

=== TOOL OUTPUT START ===
[{"alertname":"OOMKilled","pod":"pod-1","namespace":"default","severity":"critical","state":"firing","startsAt":"{TIMESTAMP}","summary":"Container killed due to OOM","description":"Pod pod-1 exceeded memory limit of 512Mi"},{"alertname":"OOMKilled","pod":"pod-1","namespace":"default","severity":"critical","state":"resolved","startsAt":"{TIMESTAMP}","endsAt":"{TIMESTAMP}","summary":"Container killed due to OOM","description":"Pod pod-1 exceeded memory limit of 512Mi"},{"alertname":"OOMKilled","pod":"pod-1","namespace":"default","severity":"critical","state":"resolved","startsAt":"{TIMESTAMP}","endsAt":"{TIMESTAMP}","summary":"Container killed due to OOM","description":"Pod pod-1 exceeded memory limit of 512Mi"}]
=== TOOL OUTPUT END ===

## Your Task:
Based on the investigation context above, provide a concise summary of the tool result that:
- Preserves information most relevant to what the investigator was looking for
- Removes verbose or redundant details that don't impact the investigation
- Maintains technical accuracy and actionable insights
- Fits naturally as the next observation in the investigation conversation

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Return ONLY the summary text. Do NOT include "Final Answer:", "Thought:", "Action:", or any other formatting.

=== MESSAGE: assistant ===
OOMKilled alert fired 3 times in the last hour for pod-1.
