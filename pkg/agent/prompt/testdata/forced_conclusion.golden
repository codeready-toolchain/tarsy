You have reached the investigation iteration limit (3 iterations).

Please conclude your investigation by answering the original question based on what you've discovered.

**Conclusion guidance:**
- Use the data and observations you've already gathered
- Perfect information is not required - provide actionable insights from available findings
- If gaps remain, clearly state what you couldn't determine and why
- Clearly distinguish between conclusions supported by tool-gathered evidence and those based only on the original alert data
- If most tool calls failed, returned errors, or produced no meaningful data, explicitly state that your analysis is limited and primarily based on alert data
- Focus on practical next steps based on current knowledge

Provide a clear, structured conclusion that directly addresses the investigation question.
